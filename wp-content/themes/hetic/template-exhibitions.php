            In the winter of 2014, JR was invited by the New York City Ballet to create a large-scale art installation, in collaboration with the dancers of the Company, for their 2014 Art Series.
            <br>
            <br>
            JR photographed dancers interacting with paper, his favorite medium, and then created a massive trompe l'oeil rendering of an eye created with life-size photos of NYCB dancers on the floor of the Promenade. A large pasting was also done on the front windows of the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center â€” during three special performance evenings on January 23, February 7, and 13, 2014, when every seat in the house was available for just $29. On these evenings, every audience member received a takeaway created specifically for this event.
